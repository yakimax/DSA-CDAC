Radix Sort is a linear sorting algorithm that sorts elements by processing them digit by digit.
It is an efficient sorting algorithm for integers or strings with fixed-size keys.



Radix Sort distributes the elements into buckets based on each digitâ€™s value.
From the least significant to the most significant,
 


Step 1: Find the largest element in the array, which is 802.
It has three digits, so we will iterate three times,
once for each significant place.



Step 2: Sort the elements based on the unit place digits (X=0) .


Step 3: Sort the elements based on the tens place digits .
